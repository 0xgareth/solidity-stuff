# Random smart contract projects

This repo is a collection of smart contracts built to learn solidity. Most contracts are written from examples at https://solidity-by-example.org/. I chose examples I found to be interesting and deployed locally using hardhat, and interacted with EthersJs to play around with calling contracts.
